## Prereqs

For this lab, you will need access to a PKS Ninja lab environment with a working PKS 1.2 deployment and a PKS deployed kubernetes cluster.

If you do not already have a prepared lab environment, you can follow the steps in the [Try Some Labs!](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/Courses/CommunityLabs-CL7056) course to fully prepare a lab environment to complete this lab guide.

You will need an account on Pivnet to download udpate tile and stemcells. If you do not have a Pivnet account, follow the directions to create one here: https://account.run.pivotal.io/z/uaa/sign-up

_NOTE: Versions of PKS referred to in this lab guide may differ from the version you use to upgrade. For an instructor led lab, your lab guide will instruct you on the versions to use. For a self-led lab, you will need to determine the next viable upgrade version and adjust._

## Step 1: Review Current Versions Detail

1.1 From the ControlCenter desktop, login to Opsman from the browser with username `admin` and pasword `VMware1!`

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.1</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-02-17-40.png"></details><br>

1.2 View the BOSH Director and PKS Tile versions _(In this case, the versions are v2.3-build.146 and v1.2.0.build.47)_ When you upgrade PKS, you need to know the specific versions of BOSH and PKS you are running in order to know which version you can move up to. If you are upgrading at each release _(and you should be)_ , this is not a necessary check.

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.2</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-20-19-57.png"></details><br>

1.3 View the current stemcell version. From the Opsman dashboard, click on `Stemcell Library`

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.3</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-20-45-01.png"></details><br>

1.4 Sign in to Pivnet and access the PKS 1.2.0 release page _(Right click and open in new tab)_ https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service#/releases/191865.


<details><summary>Screenshot 1.4</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-02-11-44.png"></details><br>

1.5 Scroll down and review the release details. You'll notice that version 1.2.0 includes Kubernetes 1.11.2, AWS EC2 support, NSX-T 2.3 integration, etc., and that the required stemcell version is 97.17. You can click on `Release Notes*` for extended information. Compare these versions to the information you observed above.

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.5</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-20-39-53.png"></details><br>

1.6 Scroll up and select release 1.2.6 from the `Releases` dropdown list

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.6</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-20-52-55.png"></details><br>

1.7 Scroll down and review the `Depends On` and `Upgrades From` sections in the Release Details pane. Notice that this release can upgrade from PKS release 1.2.0 and that it depends on particular BOSH release versions. Notice that the stemcell version will need to be upgraded as well.

_NOTE: Based on the versions we observed above, we are ok to upgrade from PKS v1.2.0.build.47 but we are not ok to upgrade based on BOSH v2.3-build.146 (You can click on the depends on and upgrades from links to determine the equivelant build numbers). In real use, we would upgrade BOSH before upgrading PKS. To save time in the lab, we will upgrade PKS with the current version of BOSH._

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.7</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-22-16-01.png"></details><br>

1.8 Click on `2.3.1-2.3.8` link in the `Depends On` section

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.8</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-23-16-10-26.png"></details><br>

1.9 Select `2.3.1` from the Release dropdown

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.9</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-23-16-13-29.png"></details><br>

1.10 Locate the vSphere Opsman file and maake a note of the release and build number. In this case, it's release 2.3.1 build 167. This is higher than the version we are running as observed earlier

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.10</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-23-16-15-44.png"></details><br>

1.11 Open a `Putty `session to `cli-vm` (if it's not already open). Submit the command `kubectl get nodes` to view the current version of your kubernetes cluster

_NOTE: If you receive an error, log back into to PKS controller and submit the get-credentials command for your cluster. (e.g. `pks login -a pks.corp.local -u pks-admin -p VMware1! --skip-ssl-validation` -> `pks get-credentials my-cluster`)_

<details><summary>Screenshot 1.11</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-01-16-24.png"></details><br>

## Step 2: Prepare for Opsman Upgrade

**Note: Your instructor may have you skip the Opsman upgrade steps in this lab to save time. Be sure to skip ahead to [Step 4: Prepare for PKS Upgrade](#step-4-prepare-for-pks-upgrade) if that is the case.**

Now that we know which versions we're on and which version we can upgrade to, the next step is to download the required files.

2.1 From the Pivnet Opsman 2.3.1 download page (https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service#/releases/271781),  click the `Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager for vSphere - 2.3-build.167` link to download

<details><summary>Screenshot 2.1</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-23-16-23-50.png"></details><br>

<details><summary>Screenshot 5.11.2</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-18-23-48-34.png"></details><br>

## Step 6: Upgrade CLI Tools

In this section, you will copy the updated pks and kubectl CLI tools to your CLI VM. When you upgrade a PKS version, you are upgrading your Kubernetes and PKS API versions. This requires an update to the CLI tools you use to interact with the services. You will use the Putty pscp utility to copy the downloaded files to the cli-vm

6.1 From the ControlCenter desktop, open a Windows command prompt

<details><summary>Screenshot 6.1</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-03-09-21.png"></details><br>

6.2 Execute the following command to update the `pks` cli tool

```
pscp E:\Downloads\pks-linux-amd64-1.2.5-build.5 root@cli-vm.corp.local:/usr/local/bin/pks
```
<details><summary>Screenshot 6.2</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-00-14-25.png"></details><br>

6.3 Type `y` and `Enter` to accept the cli-vm key signature

<details><summary>Screenshot 6.3</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-00-16-14.png"></details><br>

6.4 From the ControlCenter command prompt, execute the following command to update the `kubectl` cli tool

```
pscp E:\Downloads\kubectl-linux-amd64-1.11.6 root@cli-vm.corp.local:/usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

<details><summary>Screenshot 6.4</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-00-27-07.png"></details><br>

## Step 7: Verify  Upgrade

7.1 Check on the Opsman deployment of the PKS update and ensure that it has completed successfully. Click on `Return to Dashboard`. Notice the upgraded versions of the BOSH and PKS tiles.

_NOTE: If you only uprgaded PKS, BOSH tile will have a different varion than the image below._

<details><summary>Screenshot 7.1.1</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-00-36-33.png"></details>
<details><summary>Screenshot 7.1.2</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-23-20-04-06.png"></details><br>

7.2 Open a `Putty `session to `cli-vm` (if it's not already open). Submit the command `kubectl get nodes` to view the upgraded version of your kubernetes cluster

_NOTE: If you receive an error, log back into to PKS controller and submit the get-credentials command for your cluster. (e.g. `pks login -a pks.corp.local -u pks-admin -p VMware1! --skip-ssl-validation` -> `pks get-credentials my-cluster`)_

7.3 Observe the upgraded version of Kubernetes with the `kubectl get nodes` command. You should see that you've upgraded your Kubernetes clusters from 1.11.2 to 1.11.6.

<details><summary>Screenshot 7.3</summary><img src="Images/2019-01-19-01-26-17.png"></details><br>


## Summary

You have successfully upgraded the PKS and Kuberbetes environment. The PKS control plane is now updated and the Kubernetes clusters are running secured, validated, and updated versions of Linux and Kubernetes. Your replica set pods continued to run throughout the upgrade as a result of the BOSH canary upgrade process. You should be enabled to apply the above process to upgrading any version of PKS.

At the time this guide was written, PKS 1.3.0 was released. You can follow the upgrade procedures above to continue an upgrade to PKS v1.3.0.
