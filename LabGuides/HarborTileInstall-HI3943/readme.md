#### You have now completed the Harbor installation

## Enable Harbor Client Secure Connections

Harbor's integration with PKS natively enables the PKS Control Plane hosts and Kubernetes nodes for certificate based communications with Harbor, but most environments have additional external hosts that need to negotiate communication with harbor other than just K8s nodes. For example, developer workstations, pipeline tools,etc

To ensure developer and automated workflows can have secure interaction with Harbor, a certificate should be installed on the client machine

Please complete the [Installing Harbor Cert on External Clients](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/LabGuides/HarborCertExternal-HC7212) lab guide to learn the required steps and prepare cli-vm with needed configuration to complete other harbor exercises if you plan to proceed with additional harbor lab guides.

This lab guide does not include steps to validate the harbor installation because it takes time to deploy harbor, so after installation and client prep is a good natural break. To continue with validation, please continue with the next step from your course guide, or refer to the [PKS Ninja SE course guide agenda](https://github.com/CNA-Tech/PKS-Ninja/tree/master/Courses/PksNinjaSe-NI6310#ninja-labs-part-1-agenda) for next steps
