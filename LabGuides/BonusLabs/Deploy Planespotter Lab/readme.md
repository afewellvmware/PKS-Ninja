# Deploy Plane Spotter App

--------------
### This lab requires a working Kubernetes cluster. If you haven't completed the Deploy  Your First Cluster Lab, do that now.

## Overview of App

Now that we have a Kubernetes cluster, let's look at the magic of Kubernetes by deploying an application. For this exercise we will be using an app called 'planespotter' developed by the very talented @yfauser [here](https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter). Planespotter essentially lets you query Aircraft data from the FAA Registry. It has the following components

1. Front-end: User interface to take queries and showcase results
2. API App server: to retrieve data from DB
3. MySQL DB: Stores Aircraft registration data from FAA
4. Redis-server: Memory cache server to fetch data of Aircrafts currently airborne

Explore the YAML files that will be used for the deployments (Located in ~/planespotter/kubernetes). For example look at the front-end deployment YAML file to see how many pods and replicas the deployment YAML has specified. The deployment YAML for planespotter-frontend has specified 2 replica sets, hence post deployment you should see two pods deployed for the frontend app. 

Similarly, take a note of the labels the frontend service has been allocated. These labels will be used to built the frontend loadbalancer when we expose the app. Kubernetes will understand which pods to route the incoming traffic for the front-end loadbalancer. The traffic is routed via pod labels, hence there is no need to configure IP addresses, host names etc.

With Kubernetes, each component needed for the app is defined in the deployment YAML. The deployment YAML identifies the base container image , the dependencies needed from the infrastructure etc. The yaml files also create an API service that frontends the component-pod.

In the Intro to Harbor lab, we modified one of the manifests (.yaml file) to pull an image from our private Harbor registry.If you haven't completed the Intro to Harbor lab, all images will be pulled from the remote registry.

-------------
_If you've completed the Intro to Intro to Harbor lab, you'll already have the Planespotter repo cloned locally; If you haven't, you will need to clone it. Follow the directions below from the `cli-vm` to clone the repo for this lab:_

- `cd ~`
- `git clone https://github.com/yfauser/planespotter.git`

--------------

## Step 1: Configure K8s Cluster for App Deployment

1.1 Create namespace "planespotter" and set the namespace as your default

- `kubectl create ns planespotter`
- `kubectl config set-context my-cluster --namespace planespotter`

1.2 Verify your namespace has been created

- `kubectl get namespaces`

1.3 Create a storage class

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/storage_class.yaml`

1.3 Create a persistent volume claim for MySQL 

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/mysql_claim.yaml`

_The above commands will create a storage class and generate a persistent volume claim needed to store data for the MySQl server , this claim will generate a 2 GB volume. Explore the YAML files to see what will be claimed, the volume type, the amount of storage needed etc._

1.4 Verify the persistent volume has been generated.
 
- `kubectl get pv`

## Step 2: Deploy Planespotter

2.1  Deploy the MySQL Pod

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/mysql_pod.yaml`

2.2 Verify the MySQL pod has deployed

- `kubectl get pods --namespace planespotter`

_You should see the pod created with name 'mysql-0'_

2.3 Deploy the App-Server Pod 

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/app-server-deployment_all_k8s.yaml`

2.4 Deploy the Frontend

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/frontend-deployment_all_k8s.yaml`

2.5 Deploy Redis and the ADSB Sync Service

- `kubectl create -f ~/planespotter/kubernetes/redis_and_adsb_sync_all_k8s.yaml`

2.6 Verify all the pods needed for front-end, redis, DBC Sync services and App server (7 total) have been deployed and have entered Running state

- `kubectl get pods --namespace planespotter`
- `kubectl get services --namespace planespotter`

## Step 3: Publish the Planespotter app to expose it to the outside world

The planespotter app has been deployed with micro-services created for each sub-components; however, if you take a closer look at the services created, you will see they are all using IP addresses from the k8s cluster pool. These are not routable outside of the cluster. In order to expose a service to external connections, we can create a node-port service type or a Load Balancer service type. For the plane spotter app we will be exposing the 'frontend' service with a load balancer. PKS utilizes an automatically created NSX Load Balancer in this case.

3.1 Expose the planespotter-frontend with the following command

```
kubectl expose deployment planespotter-frontend \
--name=planespotter-frontend-lb --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer --namespace=planespotter
```

3.2 Check the external URL/IP address assigned to the service (make note of the first IP addres under External-IP).

- `kubectl get service planespotter-frontend-lb`

3.3 Copy the IP under the "External-IP" section and point your browser to that location.

A freshly deployed app based on 4 micro-services is ready!

## Step 4: Understanding how Kubernetes Maintains state by looking at an example of ReplicaSets. 

4.1 Replicasets in Kubernetes make sure that when a deployment is made 'x' number of pods for that deployment are always running. For the Planespotter frontend deployment we specified '2' replicas to always run, take a look at the deployment YAML for Palanespotter frontend here

- `nano ~/planespotter/kubernetes/frontend-deployment_all_k8s.yaml`

Notice where it states _replicas: 2_ under the _spec:_ heading.

4.2 Look at the number of pods running for the frontend service. You should see 2 replicas of the planespotter-frontend running.

- `kubectl get pods -n planespotter`

4.3 Delete one of the Pods running the frontend service

- Copy the name of one of the pods that starts with 'planespotter-frontent-' and delete it

- `kubectl delete pod <name of your planespotter-frontend-pod> -n planespotter`

4.4 List the Pods still running for frontend

- `kubectl get pods -n planespotter`

Notice the count of pods for planespotter-frontend has not changed, there are still 2 pods. The name of one of the pods is now different than before ( the unique number in the name) and the age is more recent than the other. Kubernetes just created a new pod after the original pod was deleted in order to maintain declared state.
